Prompt:

Build a professional-grade web and mobile application called Addis Exporter Analytics, designed for Ethiopian coffee exporters to track, analyze, and present their coffee inventory from farm level to export readiness.

Purpose

The app should allow Addis Exporter to upload Excel sheets of coffee inventory and automatically transform them into a rich, interactive analytics dashboard with traceability and QR code generation for each export batch.

Core Features
1. Excel-to-Dashboard Converter

Users upload Excel sheets containing coffee lots, prices, farm data, and processing details.

The system cleans, structures, and converts the data into an interactive business analytics dashboard.

Enable filtering, sorting, and visualization by region, processing method, price, or status.

Allow exporting summarized reports as PDF, Excel, or CSV.

2. Coffee Classification Engine

Automatically classify each coffee lot by:

Region: (Sidamo, Guji, Yirgacheffe, Jimma, Harar, etc.)

Processing Method: Washed, Natural, Honey, Experimental

Price Tier: Low, Mid, Premium

Altitude Range: Based on provided data

Generate visual summaries and charts showing:

Coffee distribution by region

Processing method share

Price trends over time

Volume purchased vs. exported

3. Lot Tracking & Traceability

Assign each coffee lot a unique batch ID.

Display origin details including:

Farm or washing station name

Region and woreda

Altitude grown

Number of smallholder farmers (or name if single-farm)

Processing method and drying type

Total volume purchased and export-ready volume

Include a progress tracker (e.g., Farm → Processing → Warehouse → Export Ready).

4. QR Code Generation

For every export-ready batch, generate a unique QR code.

When scanned, the QR code opens a traceability page showing:

Batch ID

Region and altitude

Farmer(s) or cooperative

Processing method

Number of contributing smallholders

Photos (if available)

Notes for roasters (flavor profile, cupping score, etc.)

Option to print QR codes or download in PNG/SVG format for bag labeling.

5. AI Data Assistant

Integrate an intelligent chat agent that understands the uploaded data.

Users can ask questions like:

“Which region had the highest price per kg this season?”

“How many washed coffees are export-ready?”

“Show me all natural lots from Guji above 1900m.”

The agent returns accurate, data-based answers, summaries, or visual charts in real time.

6. Dashboard Analytics

Key performance metrics:

Total lots

Total purchase cost

Average price per kg

Total export-ready volume

Regional contribution breakdown

Processing method distribution

Interactive visualizations (maps, bar charts, pie charts, timelines).

Option to filter by date range, season, or buyer.

7. User Experience & Security

Clean, export-industry standard UI (inspired by professional dashboards like PowerBI or Notion).

Multilingual support: English and Amharic.

Mobile responsive design.

Secure login, encrypted data storage, and role-based access (Admin, Staff, Viewer).

Tech Stack Recommendations

Frontend: React or Next.js + TailwindCSS

Backend: Python (FastAPI/Django) or Node.js (Express)

Database: PostgreSQL or Firebase

Visualization: Recharts, Plotly, or Apache ECharts

QR Generation: qrcode or pyqrcode library

AI Agent: LLM (GPT API or Llama3) with data-context training

File Parsing: Pandas (Python) or SheetJS (JS)

Goal

Create a high-standard, intelligent, and visually powerful tool that empowers Addis Exporter to:

Manage inventory from farm to export-ready stage

Provide transparent data to roasters and partners

Turn raw Excel data into actionable insights and interactive dashboards

Showcase Ethiopian coffee traceability with QR-coded batch storytelling
